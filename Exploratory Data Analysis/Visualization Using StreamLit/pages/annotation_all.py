# Check Annotations

- Annotations are organized in CSV files for each session


### Observations
- The annotation file contains:
    - the annotation by all 10 evaluators
    - total evaluation (Average)
    - Segment times for WAV file (NOT SURE if this is relevant:: WAV files are already split into corresponding segments)
    - labels for both emotion and arousal/valence are provided
    
- We are interested in labels for overall valence and arousal  (Total Evaluation), we we can discard other columns


#### There are some samples with dual emotions. eg.
- angry;neutral;disqust;fear;sad 
- happy;neutral;disqust etc.
- surprise;neutral 


As such multiple labels are due to having equally scored by the annotators. Any of those labels can be used.
- We selected the labels with least number of samples in the dataset

## In the Plot
- The center part is all green: most of the samples are neutral
- Blue(Angry) one on the right bottom corner indicates, there is something wrong with the dataset annotation.
    - Anngry should be considered as a negative emotion and it is more reasonable to have those samples on either HALV or LALV quadrants.
    - Fear usually has higher arousal and it is also an emotion with low valence. But it does not appear to be the case in this dataset.
    - Happy on the top right quadrant makes sense.
