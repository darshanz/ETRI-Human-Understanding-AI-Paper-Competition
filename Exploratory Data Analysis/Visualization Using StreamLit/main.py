### Initial Observation

- Data was collected during conversation
- The videos watched before the conversation can be considered the stimulus videos, however the conversation is the primary stimulus.
- (Role of the videos is not clear, the emotion during the conversation not only depends on the videos but also on the conversational context)
- The video was labeled by external annotators.
- Based on majority vote of the external annotators.
- Video was recorded during the conversation. 
- The external annotators tagged the speech segments while listening to the recorded utternaces.
- It is not clear whether the evaluators had access to the facial expressions.

### Questions to be explored
- What is the size of the data, is there any data excluded/missing?
- What is the distribution of different labels. Are there any outliers?
- Is there any special consideration needed before building a classification/prediction model?
